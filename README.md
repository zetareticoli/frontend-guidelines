# Fron-tend Guidelines
A one-page document to help your team establish effective frontend guidelines, so that you can write consistent & cohesive code together.

## HTML
## HTML Principles
- **What are some general principles your team should follow when writing HTML?** *(for example, authoring semantic HTML5 markup, accessibility, etc. See [these](http://www.yellowshoe.com.au/standards/#html) [resources](http://codeguide.co/#html) for [inspiration](http://manuals.gravitydept.com/code/html))*


## HTML Tools
- **Sass preprocessor** and **SCSS syntax** for stylesheet files, using `.scss` extension
- **[Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/)** for templating engine
- **Gulp** to run a helpful tasks such as: compiling your Sass files to CSS, processing assets files (JS, images,icons), optimizing and building files for production and more
- **[Fractal](https://fractal.build)** for components library and style guide

## HTML Style
- Indent yout code using 2 spaces, not tabs
- Use comments carefully defining start and end of a block in a way like: `<!-- BLOCK NAME - Start --> <!-- BLOCK NAME - End -->`
- **What order to follow for classnames**?

## CSS

## Principles
- **What are some general principles your team should follow when writing CSS?** *(For example, modularity, avoiding long selector strings, etc. See [these](http://cssguidelin.es/) [resources](http://www.yellowshoe.com.au/standards/#css) [for](http://manuals.gravitydept.com/code/css) [inspiration](http://codeguide.co/#css))*

## Methodology
We adopt [BEM](https://en.bem.info/method/) methodology.
- **Are you deviating from the methodology in any way?** If so, can you highlight these conventions?

## Tools
- **Is the team using a preprocessor** *(such as [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) or [Less](http://lesscss.org/))*?
- **What are the guidelines for using that preprocessor** *(check out [Sass Guidelines](https://sass-guidelin.es/) for inspiration)*?
- **Are you using a CSS base** *(such as [Normalize](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) or a [reset](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/))*?
- **Are you using any CSS postprocessors** *(such as [Prefixfree](https://leaverou.github.io/prefixfree/) or [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer))*?
- **Are you using CSS Custom Properties**? If so, explaing the difference with Sass variables
- **Are there specific CSS techniques you're utilizing** *(such as [critical CSS](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/08/understanding-critical-css/))*?


## Syntax

1. [Intending](#indenting)
2. [Declaration sorting](#declaration-sorting)
3. [Encoding](#encoding)

### Common rules
- two (2) spaces indents, no tabs;
- 80-characters wide lines;
- *one space* before the opening brace of declaration blocks for legibility
- Place closing braces of declaration blocks on a new line
- Include one space after `: `for each declaration
- Each declaration should appear on its own line for more accurate error reporting
- End all declarations with `;`. The last declaration's is optional, but your code is more error prone without it.
- Comma-separated property values should include a space after each comma
- Lowercase all hex values, e.g., `#fff`
- Use shorthand hex values where available, e.g., `#fff` instead of `#ffffff`.


```css
/* Bad CSS */
.selector, .selector-secondary, .selector[type=text] {
  padding:15px;
  margin:0px 0px 15px;
  background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
  box-shadow:0px 1px 2px #CCC,inset 0 1px 0 #FFFFFF
}

/* Good CSS */
.selector,
.selector-secondary,
.selector[type="text"] {
  padding: 15px;
  margin-bottom: 15px;
  background-color: rgba(0,0,0,.5);
  box-shadow: 0 1px 2px #ccc, inset 0 1px 0 #fff;
}
```

### Declaration sorting
Related property declarations should be grouped together following the order:
1. Positioning
2. Box model
3. Typographic
4. Visual
5. Misc

```scss
.declaration-order {
  /* Positioning */
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  right: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  left: 0;
  z-index: 100;

  /* Box-model */
  display: block;
  float: right;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;

  /* Typography */
  font: normal 13px "Helvetica Neue", sans-serif;
  line-height: 1.5;
  color: #333;
  text-align: center;

  /* Visual */
  background-color: #f5f5f5;
  border: 1px solid #e5e5e5;
  border-radius: 3px;

  /* Misc */
  opacity: 1;
}
```

Positioning comes first because it can remove an element from the normal flow of the document and override box model related styles. The box model comes next as it dictates a component's dimensions and placement.

Everything else takes place inside the component or without impacting the previous two sections, and thus they come last.

Use [PostCSS VSCode Plugin](https://github.com/hudochenkov/postcss-sorting#options) to automatically sorting your code with [this configuration](postcss-settings.json). Copy settings in your VSCode *settings.json*.


### Indenting
When indenting in Sass, stick **two(2) spaces** and **leave a blank line** before and after the nested ruleset:
```scss
foo {
  color: red;

  .bar {
    color: blue;
  }

}
```

### Selector Nesting in Sass
**Avoid selector nesting as much as possible.** The problme is that it makes code more difficult to read.
- Don't nest more than 3 leves deep, following the [Inception Rule](http://thesassway.com/beginner/the-inception-rule)
- Use along with BEM naming convention to generate `.block_element`



### Encoding
To avoid any potential issue with character encoding, it is highly recommended to force UTF-8 encoding in the main stylesheet using the @charset directive. Make sure it is the very first element of the stylesheet and there is no character of any kind before it.
```css
@charset 'utf-8'
```

### Quotes
Wrap Sass strings in single quotes.
```scss
// Yep
$direction: 'left';

// Nope
$direction: left;
```

### Strings as CSS values
Specific CSS values (identifiers) such as initial or sans-serif require not to be quoted
```scss
// Yep
$font-type: sans-serif;

// Nope
$font-type: 'sans-serif';
```

### Strings containing quotes
If a string contains one or several single quotes, one might consider wrapping the string with double quotes (") instead, in order to avoid escaping characters within the string.

```scss
// Yep
@warn "You can't do that.";
```

### URLs
URLs should be quoted as well, for the same reasons as above:
```scss
// Yep
.foo {
  background-image: url('/images/kittens.jpg');
}

// Nope
.foo {
  background-image: url(/images/kittens.jpg);
}
```

### Units & Numbers
- Numbers shouldn't display leading zeros before a decimal value less than one. 
- When dealing with lengths, a `0` value should never ever have a unit (e.g., `margin: 0;` instead of `margin: 0px;`)
- Don't prefix property values or color parameters with a leading zero (e.g., `.5` instead of` 0.5` and `-.5px` instead of `-0.5px`)
```scss
// Yep
.foo {
  padding: 2em;
  opacity: .5;
  margin: 0;
}

// Nope
.foo {
  margin: 0em;
  padding: 2.0em;
  opacity: 0.5;
}
```

#### Calculations
Top-level numeric calculations should always be wrapped in parentheses.
```scss
// Yep
.foo {
  width: (100% / 3);
}

// Nope
.foo {
  width: 100% / 3;
}
```

### Colors
Respect the following order of preference for color formats:

1. HSL notation;
2. RGB notation;
3. HEX notation (lowercase and shortened);

```scss
// Yep
.foo {
  color: hsl(0, 100%, 50%);
}

// Also yep
.foo {
  color: rgb(255, 0, 0);
}

// Meh
.foo {
  color: #f00;
}

// Nope
.foo {
  color: #FF0000;
}

// Nope
.foo {
  color: red;
}
```
When using HSL or RGB notation, always add a single space after a comma (,) and no space between parentheses ((, )) and content.
```scss
// Yep
.foo {
  color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  background: hsl(300, 100%, 100%);
}

// Nope
.foo {
  color: rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
  background: hsl( 300, 100%, 100% );
}
```

#### Color Variables

Store color variables in another variable with a name explaining how it should be used:
```scss
$main-theme-color: $sass-pink;
```

#### Maps
Maps should be written as follows:

- space after the colon (:);
- opening brace (() on the same line as the colon (:);
- quoted keys if they are strings (which represents 99% of the cases);
- each key/value pair on its own new line;
- comma (,) at the end of each key/value;
- trailing comma (,) on last item to make it easier to add, remove or reorder items;
- closing brace ()) on its own new line;
- no space or new line between closing brace ()) and semi-colon (;).
```scss
// Yep
$breakpoints: (
  'small': 767px,
  'medium': 992px,
  'large': 1200px,
);

// Nope
$breakpoints: ( small: 767px, medium: 992px, large: 1200px );
```

You should do your best to support as many environments as possible while simultaneously optimizing for the environments that make the most sense for your business and users. 

- **What browsers are you *optimizing* for?** 
- **What devices are you *optimizing* for?** 
- **Are you using a [graded browser support](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Graded-Browser-Support) system?**

-----------

## Documentation
- **Are you using a [pattern library tool](http://styleguides.io/tools.html) to document your front-end architecture?**
- **Where does your documentation live?** What are the links to the documentation?
- **Who's responsible for maintaining and governing the documentation?**
- **What happens when the guidelines are updated?**
